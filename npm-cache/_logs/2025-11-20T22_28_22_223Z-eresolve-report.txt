# npm resolution error report

While resolving: fortune-wheel@0.0.0
Found: react@19.2.0
node_modules/react
  react@"^19.2.0" from the root project

Could not resolve dependency:
peer react@"^18.2.0" from react-custom-roulette@1.4.1
node_modules/react-custom-roulette
  react-custom-roulette@"*" from the root project

Fix the upstream dependency conflict, or retry
this command with --force or --legacy-peer-deps
to accept an incorrect (and potentially broken) dependency resolution.
